Here's a breakdown of the current situation: PostgreSQL's Rise in Cloud Popularity: Open Source and Feature-Rich: Being open-source and offering a comprehensive feature set with strong community support, PostgreSQL has become a compelling alternative to proprietary cloud database offerings. Cloud Provider Support: Major cloud providers like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure all offer managed PostgreSQL services, indicating recognition of its growing demand. Strengths: PostgreSQL boasts strengths in areas like complex queries, data integrity, and extensibility, making it suitable for various data-intensive applications in the cloud. However, there are still strong contenders: MySQL: Remains a popular choice, especially for smaller projects and those already invested in the MySQL ecosystem. Its ease of use and familiarity for many developers contribute to its continued adoption. Cloud-Specific Databases: Cloud providers offer their own proprietary database services, often built on open-source technologies like PostgreSQL or MySQL. These services often integrate tightly with other cloud offerings, providing convenience and potential performance benefits.
